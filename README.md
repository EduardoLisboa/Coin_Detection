## Coin Detection
Simple coin detection algorithm using OpenCV, Numpy and Matplotlib in Python 3.7.6

I used **HoughCircles** function from OpenCV to detect coins in a given image.
Numpy to round the results and Matplotlib to plot the resulting image.

It's optimized for this image, but might work in other images too.

To run the code on terminal:
```python coins.py```
